Help you to get help in Support Forum.

== Description ==

Sometimes we break things in WordPress.
It could be the theme, plugins or some custom code.

When this happens we should go to the official Support Forum (there is one in your native language for sure) looking for help, but sometimes  we don't know what we should say about our problem.

That's why we created the Support Helper.

= Features =

For now we can:

* Get log info from any link without set WP_DEBUG.
* Share website NOT SENSITIVE information with support forum volunteers.

What's in your mind:

* Create a way to get diagnostic and make some basic verifications even with website down through FTP.

= Translations =

* Upload the entire `support-helper` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
